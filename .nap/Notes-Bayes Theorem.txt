Bayes' Theorem

In probability theory and statistics,
Bayes' theorem describes the probability of an event,
based on prior knowledge of conditions that might
be related to the event.

Bayes' theorem is stated as the following equation:

  P(A|B) = P(B|A) â€¢ P(A) / P(B)

where A and B are events and P(B) != 0.
